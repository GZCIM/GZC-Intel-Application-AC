# TypeScript Issues Analysis - PortfolioTable.tsx

## Issues Identified and Lessons Learned

### 1. **Type Assertion Problems**
**Issue**: Excessive use of `(theme as any)` and `(localConfig as any)` type assertions
**Problem**: This bypasses TypeScript's type checking, leading to runtime errors
**Solution**: Define proper interfaces for theme and config objects

### 2. **Complex State Management**
**Issue**: Multiple overlapping state variables (`tableConfig`, `localConfig`, `columnSizing`)
**Problem**: State synchronization issues and race conditions
**Solution**: Consolidate state management and use proper state patterns

### 3. **Type Safety Violations**
**Issue**: Using `any` types extensively in aggregation logic
**Problem**: Runtime errors when accessing properties that don't exist
**Solution**: Define strict interfaces for all data structures

### 4. **Event Handler Type Issues**
**Issue**: Improper typing of event handlers and custom events
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors and runtime failures
**Solution**: Use proper React event types and custom event interfaces

### 5. **Array and Object Manipulation**
**Issue**: Complex array operations without proper type guards
**Problem**: Runtime errors when arrays are undefined or null
**Solution**: Add proper null checks and type guards

## Key Mistakes to Avoid:

1. **Don't use `as any`** - Always define proper types
2. **Don't mix state management patterns** - Choose one approach and stick to it
3. **Don't ignore TypeScript errors** - Fix them properly instead of suppressing
4. **Don't assume data structures exist** - Always check for null/undefined
5. **Don't use complex nested operations** - Break them into smaller, typed functions

## Recommended Approach:

1. Define strict interfaces for all data structures
2. Use proper React hooks patterns
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add comprehensive type guards
5. Use TypeScript's strict mode settings
