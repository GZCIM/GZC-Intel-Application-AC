# 2025-08-13: Configuration Sync Optimization

## Problem
User noticed a "heartbeat" refresh on the frontend page - caused by config sync running every 30 seconds

## Solution
Optimized the sync behavior to be more intelligent:
1. Changed automatic sync interval from 30 seconds to 5 minutes (300000ms)
2. Added immediate sync when "Save & Exit Edit Mode" is clicked
3. Added sync before logout to preserve user settings
4. Theme and component arrangements continue to sync in real-time through other mechanisms

## Changes Made

### 1. `/src/services/configSyncService.ts`
- Line 22: Changed default interval from 30000ms (30 seconds) to 300000ms (5 minutes)

### 2. `/src/components/TabContextMenu.tsx`
- Line 5: Added import for configSyncService
- Lines 86-96: Modified handleToggleEditMode to be async and call syncNow() when exiting edit mode

### 3. `/src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`  
- Line 4: Added import for configSyncService
- Lines 144-146: Added sync before logout to preserve user configuration

## Benefits
- Reduced unnecessary network traffic by 90% (from every 30s to every 5min)
- Immediate save when user explicitly exits edit mode
- User data preserved on logout
- Better performance and less "heartbeat" effect
- Still maintains data consistency across sessions

## Testing
- Exit edit mode triggers immediate sync
- Background sync runs every 5 minutes
- Logout preserves current configuration
- No more visible 30-second refresh heartbeat

## Status
âœ… Implemented and ready for deployment
