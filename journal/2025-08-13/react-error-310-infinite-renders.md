# 2025-08-13: React Error #310 - Infinite Re-renders Fix

## Session ID
`241e8dc3-89fd-451f-9bde-ecea7a311930`

## Problem
User reported "Minified React error #310" occurring on all tabs, preventing the application from loading. This error indicates too many re-renders, typically caused by:
- Hook order violations
- Circular dependencies in useEffect
- State updates that trigger infinite loops

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Initial Hook Violation**: `useMemo` was being called conditionally inside ResponsiveGridLayout (line 477), violating React's Rules of Hooks
2. **Circular Dependency**: The `tab` object was recalculated on every render from `currentLayout?.tabs.find()`, creating new references that triggered useEffect infinitely
3. **Dependency Array Issues**: Using full objects like `tab?.components` in dependency arrays caused unnecessary re-renders

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Hook Order Violation
**File**: `/src/components/canvas/DynamicCanvas.tsx`

Moved the grid children memoization outside the conditional render:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG - hook inside conditional):
<ResponsiveGridLayout>
  {useMemo(() => components.map(instance => (
    <div key={instance.id}>...</div>
  )), [...])}
</ResponsiveGridLayout>

// After (CORRECT - hook at component level):
const gridChildren = useMemo(() => components.map(instance => (
  <div key={instance.id}>...</div>
)), [components, currentTheme, isDragging, isResizing, isEditMode])

// Then in render:
<ResponsiveGridLayout>
  {gridChildren}
</ResponsiveGridLayout>
```

### 2. Memoized Tab Computation
**File**: `/src/components/canvas/DynamicCanvas.tsx:44`

```typescript
// Before (new reference every render):
const tab = currentLayout?.tabs.find(t => t.id === tabId)

// After (memoized):
const tab = useMemo(() => currentLayout?.tabs.find(t => t.id === tabId), [currentLayout?.tabs, tabId])
```

### 3. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
**File**: `/src/components/canvas/DynamicCanvas.tsx:93`

```typescript
// Before (object reference changes):
}, [tabId, tab?.components])

// After (stable primitive):
}, [tabId, tab?.components?.length])
```

## Key Changes Summary
- Line 44: Added `useMemo` to memoize tab computation
- Line 93: Changed dependency from `tab?.components` to `tab?.components?.length`
- Line 310-330: Created `gridChildren` memoized variable
- Line 500: Replaced inline `useMemo` with `gridChildren` variable

## Previous Related Issues
This was similar to the initial hook violation error debugged at the beginning of the session. The user correctly identified the pattern: "it looks very similar to the big error we debug for couple of days at the beginning"

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always follow React's Rules of Hooks**: Never call hooks conditionally or inside nested functions
2. **Be careful with object references in dependencies**: Objects created inline will have new references every render
3. **Use primitive values in dependency arrays when possible**: Prefer `array.length` over `array` itself
4. **Memoize derived state**: Use `useMemo` for expensive computations that depend on props/state

## Testing
- Development server restarted successfully
- Hot module replacement working
- No more React Error #310 in browser console

## Status
âœ… RESOLVED - Infinite re-render loop eliminated by fixing hook order violations and circular dependencies
