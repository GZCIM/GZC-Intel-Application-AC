# 2025-08-13: Grid Stability and Performance Improvements

## Issues Identified
1. Grid not fluid enough - React Grid Layout performance issues
2. Edit mode state not properly implemented
3. Duplicate controls outside tabs that are useless
4. Saved config notification needs centering with light theme
5. Overall stability problems

## Root Causes
1. **handleLayoutChange** is being called constantly even when not in edit mode
2. Grid is updating layouts even when dragging/resizing is disabled
3. Too many console.log statements causing performance issues
4. Missing proper edit mode boundaries
5. Notification positioning issues

## Solutions to Implement

### 1. Grid Performance

### 3. Remove Duplicate Controls
- Identify and remove any redundant buttons/controls
- Keep only necessary UI elements

### 4. Notification Styling
- Center save notifications
- Use light theme colors
- Add proper transitions

### 5. Overall Stability
- Add proper error boundaries
