# GZC Intel Application AC - Modules Status

## ✅ CORRECT APPROACH ESTABLISHED

We now have our own independent modules within the GZC Intel Application AC repository:

## 📁 CURRENT STRUCTURE:

### `source-repos/` - REFERENCE ONLY (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `gzc-intel-app/` - ✅ Clean, no modifications
- `portfolio_agregator/` - ✅ Clean, no modifications  
- `FXSpotStream/` - ✅ Clean, no modifications

**Purpose**: Read-only reference for studying existing implementations

### `modules/` - OUR INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT
- `modules/frontend/` - ✅ Created (needs Bloomberg components restored)
- `modules/backend/` - 📝 To be created
- `modules/fix-protocol/` - 📝 To be created

## 🚧 NEXT STEPS:

1. **Restore Bloomberg Components**: Copy Bloomberg volatility integration to `modules/frontend/`
2. **Create Backend Module**: Independent backend based on portfolio_agregator
3. **Create FIX Protocol Module**: Independent service based on FXSpotStream
4. **Test Modules**: Ensure each works independently
5. **Deployment Pipeline**: Build Docker images for each module

## 🔄 WORKFLOW:

```
1. Study code in source-repos/ (reference)
2. Copy/adapt code to modules/ (our work)
3. Enhance with new features (Bloomberg, etc.)
4. Test in modules/ (independent)
5. Deploy through our pipeline
```

## 📝 TODO:

- [ ] Restore Bloomberg volatility components to modules/frontend/
- [ ] Set up independent git tracking for modules/
- [ ] Create module-specific package.json files
- [ ] Build deployment pipeline for each module

This approach keeps original GZCIM repos pristine while giving us full control over our enhancements.
