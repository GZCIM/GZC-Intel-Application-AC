## 🧪 Test Methods Created

### 1. **Browser Console Test** (`browser-console-test.js`)
- Comprehensive JavaScript test that can be pasted directly into browser console
- Tests MSAL instance, localStorage, cookies, and persistence logic
- Provides persistence score (0-4)

### 2. **Test Dashboard** (`test-auth-persistence.html`)
- Interactive HTML test page with multiple test buttons
- Visual test results with color coding
- Step-by-step manual testing instructions

### 3. **Quick Test** (`test-auth-state.html`)
- Simple test page for checking authentication state
- Shows what happens at different timing intervals

## 📋 Test Instructions

### Quick Test (Recommended)
1. Open production app: https://gzc-intel-application-ac.delightfulground-653e61be.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
2. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Copy entire contents of `browser-console-test.js`
5. Paste into console and press Enter
6. Review the test results

### Manual Verification
1. **Login** to the app with Azure AD credentials
2. **Add a custom tab** (Tools → Manage Tabs → Add Tab)
3. **Add components** to the tab
4. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. **Verify**: Tabs should still be there!

## ✅ Expected Results (After Fixes)

### Console Output Should Show:
```
✅ MSAL instance found on window
✅ Accounts found: 1
✅ User is authenticated!
✅ Active account set: user@domain.com
✅ Cookie storage enabled: YES
✅ Stored user found: user@domain.com
✅ Stored layout found with X tabs
✅ TabLayoutManager would find authenticated user
✅ Tabs would be loaded from database/localStorage
✅ User memory would persist!

🎯 Persistence Score: 4/4
```

### What NOT to See:
```
❌ TabLayoutManager: User not authenticated, using default layout
❌ Would fall back to DEFAULT_LAYOUT
❌ User tabs would be lost!
```

## 🔍 Key Indicators of Success

| Indicator | Before Fix | After Fix |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **MSAL Delay** | 100ms | 500ms ✅ |
| **Auth Check Method** | useIsAuthenticated() hook | Direct msalInstance.getAllAccounts() ✅ |
| **Cookie Storage** | Disabled | Enabled ✅ |
| **Tabs Persist on Refresh** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Console Shows "using default layout"** | Yes ❌ | No ✅ |

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### PASS ✅ if:
- Persistence Score: 4/4
- Tabs remain after hard refresh
- No "using default layout" message in console
- MSAL accounts found immediately

### FAIL ❌ if:
- Persistence Score: < 2/4
- Tabs disappear after refresh
- Console shows "using default layout"
- MSAL returns 0 accounts when user is logged in

---

## 📝 Notes

- The fixes target a timing race condition where React renders before MSAL restores auth
- 500ms delay gives MSAL enough time to restore from localStorage
- Direct MSAL checks avoid React hook timing issues
- Cookie storage provides additional persistence layer

## 🚦 Current Status

**To be determined after running tests**

Run the browser console test and update this section with:
- [ ] Persistence Score: _/4
- [ ] Tabs persist after refresh: Yes/No
- [ ] MSAL restoration working: Yes/No
- [ ] Overall: PASS/FAIL
