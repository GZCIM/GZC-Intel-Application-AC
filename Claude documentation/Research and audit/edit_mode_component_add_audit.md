# Edit Mode Component Add - Audit Report

## Summary
When attempting to add a component in edit mode, the UI crashes and appears to exit edit mode instead of adding the selected component.

## Impact
- Prevents users from composing dashboards in dynamic tabs
- Causes user confusion due to sudden modal close and apparent mode change
- Risks data loss if users expect auto-save during edit flows

## Root Causes
1. Undefined variable in add handler
   - File: `Main_Frontend/src/components/ProfessionalHeader.tsx`
   - Code references `currentTab.editMode` which is not defined in that scope, causing a runtime error when adding a component.

2. Fragile tabId handoff from context menu
   - Closing the context menu before reading `contextMenu.tabId` can result in an empty tabId being used by the parent, leading to no-op or inconsistent state.

## Evidence
- `ProfessionalHeader.tsx` (snippet)
  - Uses `currentTab.editMode` inside `handleComponentSelected` while only `tab` is defined in that scope.
- `TabContextMenu.tsx`
  - `handleAddComponent` closes the menu before invoking the parent callback, which reads `contextMenu.tabId` afterward in the header.

## Recommendations (No code changes applied here)
- Fix the crash:
  - Replace `currentTab.editMode` with `tab?.editMode` in `ProfessionalHeader.tsx` within the add handler.
- Stabilize tabId passing:
  - From `TabContextMenu`, pass `tabId` as an argument to `onRequestAddComponent(tabId)` before closing the menu. In `ProfessionalHeader`, consume the `tabId` argument rather than reading mutable state.
- Add safety and resilience:
  - Add a guard before `updateTab` to ensure a valid `componentPortalTabId`.
  - Introduce a higher-level error boundary around header/app shell to prevent a single handler error from resetting UI state.
- Observability:
  - Add structured logs around component-add flow, including selected `componentId`, `tabId`, `isEditMode`, and inventory resolution results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Adding a component in edit mode does not crash.
- The selected component appears on the canvas in the targeted tab.
- Edit mode remains enabled after component addition.
- No undefined variable warnings in console.

## Suggested Minimal Edits (for future PR)
- `ProfessionalHeader.tsx`:
  - Use `editMode: tab?.editMode` (guarded) when updating the tab after add.
- `TabContextMenu.tsx` and `ProfessionalHeader.tsx` coordination:
  - Change `onRequestAddComponent?: (tabId: string) => void` and call it with the tab id; in the parent, set the portal tab id using the callback arg, then close the menu.

## Notes
This report is an auditor analysis only; no code has been changed. The issue appears reproducible from the context menu “Add Component” flow in dynamic tabs with `closable: true`.
